# Merge Conflict Resolution Summary

## Issue
PR #39 had a merge conflict in `requirements_ci.txt` between two approaches:
- **Branch** `copilot/fix-ci-local-dependency-issues`: Used pinned versions (e.g., `numpy==1.24.3`)
- **Branch** `main`: Used version ranges (e.g., `numpy>=1.24.3,<3.0.0`)

## Resolution Decision
**Chose version ranges from `main`** for the following reasons:

1. **Flexibility**: Version ranges allow CI to work with a broader set of Python versions (3.9-3.13)
2. **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain as minor updates are automatically included
3. **Compatibility**: Better compatibility with other dependencies that may require newer versions
4. **Best Practice**: Industry standard for CI/CD pipelines to use ranges rather than pinned versions

## Files Added from PR Branch
While resolving the conflict, valuable files from the PR were preserved:

### Documentation
- **`docs/CI_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`**: Comprehensive guide for debugging CI failures
  - How to compare Python versions and dependencies
  - Steps to reproduce CI environment locally (venv, Docker, act)
  - Solutions for common CI issues

### Tools
- **`scripts/compare_dependencies.py`**: Automated tool to compare local vs CI dependencies
  - Shows version mismatches
  - Identifies packages only in local or only in CI
  - Provides actionable recommendations

### Configuration
- **`.gitignore`**: Added patterns to exclude frozen dependency comparison files
  - `frozen.txt`, `frozen-*.txt`, etc.

### Summary
- **`CI_CONSISTENCY_SUMMARY.md`**: Summary of CI consistency improvements

## CI Improvements Retained
The resolution keeps the critical CI fixes from PR #39:
- âœ“ Updated to `actions/cache@v4` (fixes deprecated cache version error)
- âœ“ Added Python 3.12 support
- âœ“ Removed pinned pip version for more flexibility
- âœ“ Simplified logging (removed verbose artifact uploads)
