\section{Spectral Inversion: Primes from Zeros}
Having identified $D(s) \equiv \Xi(s)$, we now recover the arithmetic content. The explicit formula, normally derived from Euler products, can be inverted from the zero set of $D$ alone. The distribution of prime powers $\Pi$ is uniquely reconstructed from the zero set $\{\rho\}$ of $D(s)$. No Euler product or global zeta input is required: the arithmetic structure emerges as the unique inversion compatible with the spectral geometry.
