\section{Geometric Functional Equation}
The functional equation is forced not by Euler products, but by geometry. Let $J$ be the Mellin-Fourier involution $(Jf)(x) = x^{-1/2}f(x^{-1})$, $J^2 = \mathrm{Id}$. This operator implements Poisson-Radon duality on the adelic phase space, which is self-dual with respect to the symplectic form $\omega(x,\xi) = x\xi$. Acting on the generator $A_0 = 1/2 + iZ$, one finds $JA_0J^{-1} = 1 - A_0$. Consequently, the resolvent kernel and its Fredholm determinant obey the symmetry $D(1-s) = D(s)$.
