\section{Spectral Uniqueness: Paley–Wiener with Multiplicities}
The positivity argument shows that all zeros are on the critical line. To identify $D(s)$ completely, including multiplicities, we appeal to determinacy theorems of Paley–Wiener type. The DOI-trace pairings of the explicit formula on two vertical lines $\Re(s) = \sigma_0$ and $\Re(s) = 1-\sigma_0$ determine the full zero divisor, including multiplicities. With Hadamard–Cartwright growth bounds and normalization at $+\infty$, this forces $D(s) \equiv \Xi(s)$.
