\section{Spectral Emergence of Primes}
The global scaling flow $S_u : x \mapsto e^{-u}x$ acts unitarily on $L^2(\mathbb{A}^\times/\mathbb{Q}^\times)$. For each place $v$, the local scaling operator $U_v$ induced by $x \mapsto \varpi_v^{-1}x$ satisfies the commutation relation $[U_v, S_u] = 0$ for all $u \in \mathbb{R}$. On the logarithmic coordinate $\tau = \log|x|_\mathbb{A}$, this action becomes $(U_v\varphi)(\tau) = \varphi(\tau + \log q_v)$, where $q_v$ is the local norm of the uniformizer. The primitive closed orbits have lengths $\ell_v = \log q_v$. These lengths emerge from Haar invariance and global compatibility, not from arithmetic assumptions.
