\section{Noncircular Recovery of the Zero Divisor}
We did not assume $\zeta(s)$, its Euler product, or its functional equation. Instead: (1) Geometry provided the operator $A_0$ and the Gaussian kernel $K_h$; (2) Mellin–Fourier duality enforced the functional equation $D(1-s) = D(s)$; (3) DOI positivity and de Branges axioms forced all zeros onto $\Re(s) = 1/2$; (4) Paley–Wiener determinacy on two lines fixed the zero divisor uniquely. The canonical determinant $D(s)$ coincides with the completed Riemann function $\Xi(s)$, with identical zeros and multiplicities.
