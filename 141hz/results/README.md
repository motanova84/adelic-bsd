# 141Hz Analysis Results

This directory contains results from the 141.7001 Hz gravitational wave analysis.

## Files

### `offsource_null.json`
Off-source null distribution analysis results.

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "analysis_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "events": [...],
  "global_p_value": null,
  "comment": "..."
}
```

**Generated by**: Off-source analysis script (to be implemented)

## Note

Results files are typically generated by analysis scripts and are included in `.gitignore` by default. The stub files are provided as templates to show the expected structure.

To preserve results for reproducibility, consider:
1. Creating timestamped copies (e.g., `offsource_null_20251030.json`)
2. Archiving to Zenodo with DOI
3. Including hash in preregistration for verification
